This package wil remove any existing profiles on the Mac and then enroll the Mac with your server.

The Makefile needs [The Luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage) to build the package, but the postflight script could be used with your solution of choice.

Ready?

1.	Create a new enrollment profile
2. Give your enrollement profile a name
3. Download the trust profile
4. Download the enrollment profile

Rename your enrollment profile to enroll.mobileconfig and the trust profile to trust.mobileconfig, copy them to the repo directory and run a quick `make pkg`
	
You're done.
